  This list is an (admittedly futile) attempt to catalog every
  sample used by Pop <em>WILL</em> Eat Itself, as well as to
  identify the source material from which each sample was taken. It
  provides a unique opporunity for fan interaction, and hopefully
  enhances our appreciation of what the band is doing.<br />

  Graham Poppie on the subject of obtaining permission to use
  samples from the original artists:

  <blockquote>
    <strong>"Anyway, you could ask somebody and end up paying for
    something which even the writer at the end of the day may not
    [recognise because] you've altered it so much. You've put it in
    a different context, chopped it up, whatever. So I suppose if
    you were idealogically sound you would ask... But I guess we
    aren't idealogically sound."</strong><br />

    1FM

  And Just in case that wasn't <em>explicit</em> enough for ya:
