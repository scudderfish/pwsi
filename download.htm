  <h3>Pop WILL Eat Itself<br />
  Download The Sample List Here:</h3>

  <span class="c2">Okay, here's the deal... I've zipped up all the
  files for this version of <b>Pop WILL Sample Itself</b> into a
  single binary file that you can load into your own DOS or UNIX
  PC. <i>So what?</i> you say? Well, for one thing, you can
  definitely access the files faster in local mode than over a
  dialup connection... For another thing, you may be able to save
  yerself some connect-time charges.<br />
  <br />
  Here's the details:<br />
  You need PKUNZIP Version 2.x and about 2 meg of free space on
  your hard drive. The zip file is about 1.3MB, and contians over
  100 files.<br />
  <br /></span>

  <ol>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.tiac.net/users/daveread/pwsi/pwsiv402.zip">Download
    PWSI</a><br /></li>

    <li>Create a directory on your PC to hold all the pwsi files.
    ("PWSI" is a nice choice.)</li>

    <li>Run PKUNZIP (V2.x) like this: PKUNZIP PWSIV402.ZIP \PWSI\
    *.*</li>

    <li>Once the files are decompressed into your directory, access
    PWSI.HTM with your web browser. (Note that there are a few
    links that point outside the local set of files. You may get
    errors trying to access these, but hitting <b>STOP</b> should
    take care of these.</li>
  </ol><br />
  I've gotten some feedback from folks who'd like to be able to get
  the sample list in plaintext form. I'm working now on writing a
  program to do a useful html to ASCII conversion, so I can run all
  the PWSI files through it without too much hassle. (Right now the
  task of converting 100 files is just too daunting.) When the
  plaintext version is available, I'll post it here for downloading
  as well. And thanks to those of you who've sent me feedback. I
  truly appreciate it.<br />
