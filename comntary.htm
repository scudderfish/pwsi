  <h3>Pop <em>WILL</em> Eat Itself<br />
  Commentary by List-Minder:</h3>
  <hr />

  A lot of Pop <i>WILL</i> Eat Itself's music relies on samples of
  <a href="films.htm">film soundtracks</a>, <a href=
  "other.htm">spoken voice</a> recordings, <a href=
  "tv.htm">television programs</a>, and <a href=
  "music.htm">music</a>, (pop and otherwise) to provide atmosphere,
  reference points, and themes to their compositions. This
  innovative and bold approach is a large part of PWEI's appeal.
  Many fans of their music were initially drawn to PWEI by the use
  of a particular sample. In my case, it was the groundbreaking use
  of the <a href="tv.htm#Zone%20TV">Twilight Zone</a> TV theme in
  combination with the quasi-religious mantra of "Big Mac, fries to
  go!" on <a href="defcon1.htm">'Def.Con.One'</a> (Arguably their
  biggest US hit). For others, it might be <a href=
  "films.htm#DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a> intoning "Go ahead..." on
  <a href="preach.htm">'Preaching To the Perverted'</a>, <a href=
  "films.htm#Batman">Jack Nicholson's Joker</a> warning "Never rub
  <a href="rhubarb.htm">another man's rhubarb!</a>", or the gangs
  in the film <a href="films.htm#Warriors">'The Warriors'</a>
  yelling "Riffs - Yeah!" in <a href="canudig.htm">'Can U Dig
  It?'</a>. Their more recent efforts utilise multiple layers of
  shorter samples to build textural or structural foundations for
  their music. Examples of this technique include the use of the
  'Terminator 2' theme in <a href="ichbin.htm">'Ich Bin Ein
  Auslander'</a>, and U2's 'Until The End Of The World' rhythm in
  <a href="reaper.htm">'MeNoFearTheReaper'</a>. Regardless of the
  way it's applied, the technique of sampling is part of what makes
  PWEI <em>PWEI</em>!
