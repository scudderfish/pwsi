    <li class="c2"><cite># NOTE: The following two submissions
    arrived within a day or two of each other... ( The third one
    arrived as I was cleaning up the html version of the list.
    Sheesh!) I'm amazed at how often this happens. On several
    occasions, I've noticed that multiple submissions arrive during
    a short time period for a single tune or sample. Synchronicity?
    Coincidence? Mass Hysteria? Cool. _Dave_ #</cite><br />

    <li>Is a looped sample of the 2-ish minute jazzy outro of Black
    Sabbath's 'Symptom of the Universe', off their album
    'Sabotage.'<br />

    <li>Anyway - I can't believe that this has never been
    mentioned... I checked the most recent version of the sample
    list (the one on the Nation) and noticed that there are no
    "samples" for 'Familus Horribilus...' Well this isn't so much
    of a sample as it is PWEI stealing a riff from the almighty
    Black Sabbath... the whole damn tune, the music at the begining
    is taken note for note from Sabbath's 'Symptom of the
    Universe'. For anyone that may actually know what I'm talking
    about it the very end of the tune after the heavy part. I'm
    sitting here listening to this Sabbath tribute album and
    decided to actually listen to the 'Corrosion of Conformity'
    song for the first time... I said "Hey, this sounds familiar."
    Then last night as if by omen, I found disc two of the tribute
    album, which has the original versions of songs. And after
    listening to the Sabbath version, damn, that's the song. I
    can't believe no one has said this one yet. I found it
    BLATANTLY obvious. Can anyone back me up?<br />

    <li>Well, the "Future Music" article that Tezzer quotes in the
    sampling list page did not make specific mention of the track
    that featured the BIG sample from a 70's band. The piece in
    "Future Music" was out around the time the band was releasing
    the double A-sided single '<a href=
    "rsvp.htm#">RSVP</a>'/'Familus Horribilus' (October 1993), but
    the interview was obviously taken during the time of the
    single's recording. So, Richard Poppie did not specify which of
    the two tracks featured the sample in question (maybe, the
    Poppies had not yet decided at that time what the titles of the
    songs would be-at least that's the feeling I get from reading
    the article), but he was quite specific as regards to which was
    the band the sample was "stolen" from. I quote: "It's quite a
    long bit. It's just a little part from the end of a Black
    Sabbath track." What more can I say? Paying close attention to
    'Sympom of the Universe' by Black Sabbath reveals that the
    final part of the song (the instrumental part, based around the
    slow guitar arppegio), forms the backbone of 'Familus
    Horribilus', from beginning to end. The whole song is based on
    this last guitar arppegio from Black Sabbath's 'Symptom of the
    Universe.' It seems that we all have our Heavy Metal roots,
    don't we?<br />
