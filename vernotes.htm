    <blink><strong>Now a hypertext document!</strong></blink><br />
    <cite>#Don't you hate these damn Netscape
    extensions?#</cite><br />
    <br />
    Since this is the first true release version in html, I
    <em>really</em> need your feedback on how well it works (Or
    doesn't), and any suggestions for additions or
    improvements.<br />
    <strong>WARNING!</strong> There are still a bunch of dead-ends
    in this version. Sorry, but I really wanted to get it out
    there, and it seems like I'll be tracking down those multiple
    paths for quite a while!

  <blockquote>
    Note that an interim Version 3.00 was constructed, but saw
    little or no distribution, as it consisted of a single,
    enormous file which took way too long to load and navigate
    through. (And before anyone asks, no, it was never finished,
    and you can't have a copy... If there's enough interest, I'm
    willing to try to make a non-html version of this thing, so if
    that's what you want, please let me know.) This release,
    Version 4.01, is the first 'official' release since Version
    2.08, which was released in February 1995.

  <blockquote>
    There are plenty of new source IDs and interesting
    comments...<br />
    Uncredited comments are <em>still</em> leftovers from previous
    versions of the list - contributors are unknown. If anyone can
    fill in the blanks, drop me a line.

  <blockquote>
    Entirely new to this version, are the reference sections on
    some of the Poppies' favorite sample sources. I've started
    things out with what info I have, and Tezzer provided a bunch
    of links and info as well, but many entries could use fleshing
    out. (In some cases, I had little or nothing to say about a
    particular source, so I <em>really</em> need your help on
    this.) I'm on the prowl for more/better Icons, etc. too. Also,
    I think it's likely that I've misidentified the genre or style
    of some of the musical sources. If so, please let me know. If
    anyone thinks there should be more, fewer, or different source
    categories listed, I'd be interested in hearing about that too!

  <blockquote>
    Another area of concern to me is the issue of how this document
    works with various web-browsing software clients. I did the
    development using Netscape and the Delphi Beta version of
    Netscape Navigator on a PC in local mode only, and am pleased
    with the results. Unfortunately, the document is not so
    successful when accessed with the latest available alpha
    version of Mosaic for Windows. I may have installed Mosaic
    improperly, (I <strong>hate</strong> Windows!) because the
    normal text does not wrap at the edges of the window, and the
    various headings and styles do not stand out from the normal
    text. Also, Mosaic takes forever to move around through the
    documents on my 486DX33 (8meg RAM). Netscape sometimes 'burps'
    if a link is clicked on while the document is refreshing
    itself, but that only sends you to the top. Anyway, I would
    very much appreciate comments pro or con concerning these
    issues. The main difference between this version and V3.00 is
    that this one is loaded with graphics and is broken up into a
    bunch of smaller files. I'm hoping that this will help with the
    speed problem. Another proposed modification is to cross link
    this list with <a href=
    "http://kzsu.stanford.edu/uwi/pwei/pwei-lyrics.html%3EAlison's%20Lyrics%20Archive%3C/A%3E(http://kzsu.stanford.edu/uwi/pwei/lyrics.html)%20and%20%3CA%20HREF=">
    Tezzer's Discography</a>
    (http://kzsu.stanford.edu/uwi/pwei/pweidisc.html). Alison and I
    have already laid the groundwork for some of this, but it needs
    work.

    Note: Due to my inability to get this thing out the door in a
    timely manner (I started the HTML implementation in early
    March!), some contributions marked as "New" in this list
    actually appeared in V2.08 and/or V3.00. Also, I think I may
    have lost a couple of submissions in the process of
    starting/stopping/restarting my work on this (yeah, again...)
    so if you had sent me something between February and now that
    doesn't appear in the list (And wasn't superseded by someone
    else beating you to the punch...), please send me a very nasty
    note, including the contribution I lost, so that I can make
    things right.
