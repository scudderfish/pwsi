    <li>Burgess Meredith (the Penguin) doing the intro.<br /></li>

    <li>Yeah, it's Burgess Meredith, but it's from the opening of
    the <a href="tv.htm#Zone%20TV">Twilight Zone</a> episode which
    features Meredith as the last human survivor of some
    apocalyptic event, standing in front of an undamaged library.
    (He's happy, 'cause he loves books... 'Til he steps on his
    reading glasses... oops.)<br />

    <li>From '<a href="films.htm#Zone">Twilight Zone - The
    Movie</a>'. Anyway... It shows the plane in a storm and then
    has the voice over: "What you are looking at..." I remember
    this because I first saw the movie on a plane... Not very
    clever of Qantas.<br />
    <strong>[ James Ward - jpw@ecr.mu.oz.au ]</strong></li>

    <li>I could have sworn that that was the opening to the TZ
    episode about the creature on the wing of the plane with Bill
    Shatner which (surprise!) was called "Nightmare At 20,000
    Ft".<br />

    I'm talking about for the movie? _Dave_ #</cite></li>

    <li><img src="lilnew.gif" alt="(NEW!)" /> from 'Twilight Zone -
    the movie'. The final story of the movie, involves a man
    terrified of flying being the only one who sees a creature
    picking the plane apart. The whole thing starts with a shot of
    the man (played by **) locked inside the toilet, obviously
    distraught over something. The voice-over then informs us:
    "What you're looking at..."<br />

    <li><img src="lilnew.gif" alt="(NEW!)" /> one holidays we sorta
    let ourselves into a friend's parent's holiday home in a suburb
    south of Perth (where I live :) without them knowing - they had
    some weird porn tapes. The sample is from an animated porn
    movie where giant male genitalia bounce around abducting
    initially reluctant babes... somehow a plane is involved which
    crashes, the plane has a bad-tempered guy on it, it crashes
    into a swamp. "if..." is what this guy says... if you listen to
    the sample, you can hear flys buzzing 'round, this is from the
    swamp. (but I don't remember the title of the movie
    sorry!)<br />
    <strong>[ Paul Dragicevich - pdrag@uniwa.uwa.edu.au

    <li><img src="lilnew.gif" alt="(NEW!)" /> From an un-rated
    pornographic animated movie I saw several years ago and who's
    title escapes me. I think it's something like _The Untamed
    Jungle_. It involved an explorer searching for a land of
    creatures resembling penises and scrotums that moved by
    bouncing around. The pilot of the adventure, a crotchety old
    man, crashes the plane on the island then curses its existence.
    The movie was confirmed to me by Graham in 1991, but it went by
    a different name in the U.K. The name was _Forbidden Jungle_
    (at least in the U.S.). My friend who told me the title
    reminded me that the main characters were Tarzan and Jane and
    it featured masturbating monkeys and bouncing penises that shot
    semen-like missiles. Pretty bizarre. Hope this info is useful,
    if not overwhelming. (I had asked Graham about the sample after
    a show in S.F., and was curious if they got it from the same
    movie. The movie fit the description but had a different
    title.)<br />
    <strong>[ Kenneth A. Spickler - reaper@valleynet.com

    <li><img src="lilnew.gif" alt="(NEW!)" /> Was it a sort of
    adult cartoon with a really wussy Tarzan character and a nympho
    Jane? And did it involve a landscape formation that looked like
    a woman lying on her back with her legs apart? If so, it sounds
    like "Jungle Burger". I remember seeing it years ago back in
    the UK but can hardly remember anything about it but the
    bouncing penises ring the odd bell! I don't remember the "son
    of a bitch" reference but then I wasn't looking out for it at
    the time! Ha ha! I can't believe I knew that!!! Does sound like
    the kind of thing PWEI would watch!!! Can't remember where the
    hell we got hold of it either!<br />

    <li>It's off a cop show or similar. I don't think it's 'Perry
