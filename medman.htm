    <li><img src="lilnew.gif" alt="(NEW!)" /> I know this sounds
    like a long-shot, but I think this came from a late-night (i.e.
    early-morning) UK T.V. phone-in/chat show called 'The James
    Whale Radio Show'. The show had something of a cult following,
    and was airing at the same time as <a href=
    "curefors.htm#">'Cure for Sanity'</a> was being recorded.I
    distinctly remember an episode about irrational phobias, in
    which some minor celebrity had agreed to undergo hypnosis in
    order to cure their fear of flying. The hypnotist repeated the
    above line *many* times, over and over again (very tedious
    viewing - maybe that's why it sticks out in my mind so well).
    (It didn't work, by the way)<br />

    <li><img src="lilnew.gif" alt="(NEW!)" />This sample was taken
    from a relaxation/hypnosis cassette which was given to Clint by
    a therapist, so that he could deal with his fear of flying! He
    mentioned this in an interview with the NME and said he found
    it completely useless, except that it was good for a laugh! It
    apparently then dawned on him, that it would be great as an
    obscure sample. That's the story...Morning Glory.<br />
