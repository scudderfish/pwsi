        <li>AMG Entry: At the height of their career in the late
        80s and early 90s, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were among
        the top figure in house music. All of their various
        permutations -- Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, the Timelords,
        and, their most commercially successful group, the KLF --
        were very popular in the UK's underground dance scene. The
        duo created with their liberal use of samples a dense,
        throbbing house mix filled that spat in the face of all pop
        and traditions. The best example of their flippant
        disregard for tradition is their surprise crossover single,
        "Justified and Ancient," which featured the standard-issue
        bass-heavy club beat with the vocals of country legend
        Tammy Wynette. After the success of the single, KLF
        announced they had broken up and that they were immediately
        pulling all of their recordings off the market. After a
        little time off, Drummond and Cauty resumed recording under
        a variety of different names. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewi,

    <li>Old Grey Whistle Test: A Live music program put out by the
    BBC in the 70`s and 80`s, hosted by (among others) Bob Harris
    and Mark Ellen. It was (nearly) the TV equivalent of the Peel
    Session, and a lot of young, new bands received a large amount
    of exposure. Indeed, I think the first PWEI video to be shown
    on TV was `Sweet Sweet Pie`, on the `Whistle Test` but they
    also had some decidedly dodgy bands on too! The programmes are
    currently being re-run on VH-1 in Europe. <strong>[ Terry Walsh
